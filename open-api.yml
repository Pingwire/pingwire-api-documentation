  title: Moank Broker API
  version: 1.0.0
  description: |
    The Moank Broker API can be used by loan brokers with an active collaboration with Moank. With this API a broker will be able to send Moank new applications and receive from Moank a loan offer. Once the end customer has accepted Moank's offer, the broker can use the API to notify Moank and trigger the final part of the customer's journey.

    Some optional endpoints are provided to enable a broker to update an existing application as well as notifying Moank when an end customer has rejected Moank's offer.

    #Â Test objects

    Test objects can be used in the staging environment in order to test specific flow. If one of the applicant of the application has its `nationalId` equal to one of the test object, the decision returned by Moank will always be the same one as described in the following table:

    National id  |Decision
    -------------|--------
    199001011114 |`granted`
    199001019992 |`declined`

    # Callbacks

    Moank can send callbacks to a Broker when an application status is updated. The events that can be reported via callbacks are described in the following table:

    Event |Description  |Extra information
    ------|-------------|-----------------
    `debt-notice-sent`  |Triggered when Moank sends the debt notice to the customer. This mean that the customer went through all the routine checks performed by Moank's underwriters.|-
    `debt-notice-signed`|Triggered when the customer has signed his debt notice using BankID.  |-
    `paid-out`          |Triggered when Moank has paid out the money to the end customer.  |Paid out amount
    `denied`            |Triggered when Moank denies a customer because of one of the routine checks performed by Moank's underwriters. |-

    The actual payload and event names sent during the callback can be customised for each broker in order to match their own specifications.
