   This endpoint allows you to retrieve an access token by posting clientId and clientSecret as request body.

   This token can be used on subsequent API calls for authentication. Endpoints that require authentication will expect the access token in an HTTP Authorization header like this: `Authorization: Bearer <access token>`.

   This endpoint also returns a refresh token that can be used to obtain a new access token when the current access token expires. To use the refresh token, call the [refresh token endpoint](/#tag/Auth/operation/RefreshToken). The refresh token has a significantly longer expiry time than the access token.

   The login endpoint should only be used to obtain an access token when no refresh tokens are available. Once you have an access token and a refresh token, you should use the refresh token endpoint to obtain a new access token when the current access token expires, as it does not require the clientId and clientSecret to be sent again.
