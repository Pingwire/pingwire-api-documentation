   The Pingwire API uses OAuth as an authentication mechanism. This operation allows you to retrieve an access token by posting clientId and clientSecret as request body.

   This token can be used on subsequent API calls to authenticate you. Operations that support or require authentication will expect the access token in an HTTP Authorization header like this: `Authorization: Bearer <access token>`.
