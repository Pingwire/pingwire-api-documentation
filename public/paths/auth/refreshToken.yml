  summary: Refresh token
  operationId: RefreshToken
  description: |
    The refresh token can be used to obtain a new access token when the current access token expires. To use the refresh token, call this endpoint with the refresh token obtained from the login endpoint.

    The refresh token endpoint should be prioritized over the login endpoint to obtain a new access token when the current access token expires, as it does not require the clientId and clientSecret to be sent again.
