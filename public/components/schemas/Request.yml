  step:
    type: string
    enum:
    - created
    - processed
    example: processed
    description: Indicate the step the request is at. It starts as created and is later updated as processed once the recommendation and signals are available. From the create request endpoint, the response is not returned before the request as reached the processed step. This guarantees that recommendation and signals are always available in the response object.
  recommendation:
    type: string
    enum:
    - proceed
    - review
    - block
    description: Recommendation for the request. This can be used to react to triggered rules and block or put on hold the end user if applicable. The recommendation will always be available for requests at step processed. From the create request endpoint, the response is not returned before the request as reached the processed step. The recommendation is therefore always available from the create request endpoint response object.
  signals:
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
      format: ObjectId
    description: IDs of the signals that have been triggered by the rule tree for this request. Signals can be created through the graphical user interface or through the API. Signals can be used to react to specific rules being triggered in the rule tree. The signals array will always be available for requests at step processed. From the create request endpoint, the response is not returned before the request as reached the processed step. The signals array is therefore always available from the create request endpoint response object.
  process:
    type: string
    format: ObjectId
    description: ID of the process linked to that request. Processes can be created from the interface or through the API.
  segment:
    type: string
